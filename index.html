  <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Set in a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, <em>Blade Runner</em> follows Rick Deckard, a "blade runner" tasked with hunting down bioengineered beings known as replicants. These replicants, created by the Tyrell Corporation, are virtually indistinguishable from humans and are used for off-world labor. After a group of rogue replicants return to Earth seeking to extend their lifespans, Deckard is called out of retirement to "retire" them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Deckard tracks the replicants, he encounters Rachael, a replicant who believes she's human. As he questions what it means to be human, Deckard begins to empathize with the replicants, especially their leader, Roy Batty. The film ends ambiguously, questioning Deckard’s own humanity and leaving viewers to ponder the nature of life and consciousness.
